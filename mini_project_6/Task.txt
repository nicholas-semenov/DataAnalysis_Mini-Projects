Task:

1. Load the Data:
    - Load the data from `cars.csv`.
    - Check the correctness of the loaded data.
    - Check for missing values.
    - Check data types.

2. Create a New Feature:
    - Create a new feature for the car brand (company).
    - Identify which car manufacturers are present in the dataset.
    - Correct the manufacturer names if necessary and verify the changes.

3. Feature Selection and Correlation Analysis:
    - Retain only a subset of predictors.
    - Calculate the correlation between `price` and other variables.

4. Convert Categorical Variables:
    - Convert categorical variables to numerical ones using `pd.get_dummies()`.

5. Build a Model with a Single Predictor:
    - Build a linear regression model using `horsepower` as the sole predictor for price.
    - Determine the percentage of variability explained by this model (R²).

6. Build and Compare Two Models:
    - Build two linear regression models:
        - A model with all predictors.
        - A model with all predictors except for the car brands.
    - Compare the R² values, coefficients, and their significance for both models.
